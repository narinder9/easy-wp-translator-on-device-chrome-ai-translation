# Easy WP Translator – On-Device Chrome AI Translation

Translate your WordPress website into multiple languages using **free On-Device Chrome AI translation**.
No server calls, no API cost, no SaaS subscription — completely private and fast.


##  Inspiration

Building a multilingual website sounds exciting, but in reality, it is often **confusing, expensive, and time-consuming**. Many people rely on paid translation APIs or complicated plugins that send content to third-party servers.

Our goal was very simple: **Why is not website translation easy, free, and accessible for everyone?**

When Chrome introduced free **on-device AI**, we saw the **perfect opportunity** to change that. It finally made it possible to offer translations that are:

* Free to use
* Private and secure
* Simple for anyone

##  What This Plugin Does

**Easy WP Translator** helps you translate your WordPress content into different languages directly from your dashboard.

You can translate:

* Posts, Pages , Menus , Categories , Media details (alt text)


 **No Monthly Cost**

 **No External API**

 **No Coding Needed**

This plugin uses Free Chrome’s **On-Device AI (Translator API)** — so translation happens inside the user’s browser. Data never leaves the device.

##  How We Built It

We built this plugin using **Chrome’s built-in On-Device AI** (Translator API).
Everything happens *locally in the browser*:

*  No server involved
*  No API calls
*  No data sharing

### Simple Workflow

1. Open pages or posts
2. Click **Bulk Translate**
3. Choose languages
4. Your website becomes multilingual instantly

---

##  Challenges We Faced

### 1. No Website Context for AI

Chrome AI didn’t support **custom context**, so industry-specific wording sometimes lacked accuracy.

### 2. HTML Formatting Issues

During translation, some HTML tags were affected.
We added logic to **protect important tags and layout**.

### 3. Chrome Language Settings Were Hard for Users

Users struggled to set language preferences because Chrome doesn’t allow direct linking to internal settings pages.
We improved UI instructions and added step-by-step support.

##  Accomplishments

* Made website translation **easy for non-technical users**
* Fully **free and privacy-friendly** multilingual solution
* No dependency on external servers or paid APIs

---

##  What We Learned

* On-Device AI is **fast and secure** for translations
* Users love **simple UI with fewer steps**
* Most users skip documentation — so product must be self-explaining

This helped us build a smooth workflow that feels natural.
