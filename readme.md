# Easy WP Translator – On-Device Chrome AI Translation

Translate your WordPress website into multiple languages using **free On-Device Chrome AI translation**.
No server calls, no API cost, no SaaS subscription — completely private and fast.


##  Inspiration

Building a multilingual website sounds exciting, but in reality, it is often **confusing, expensive, and time-consuming**. Many people rely on paid translation APIs or complicated plugins that send content to third-party servers.

Our goal was very simple: **Why is not website translation easy, free, and accessible for everyone?**

When Chrome introduced free **on-device AI**, we saw the **perfect opportunity** to change that. It finally made it possible to offer translations that are:

* Free to use
* Private and secure
* Simple for anyone

##  What This Plugin Does

**Easy WP Translator** helps you translate your WordPress content into different languages directly from your dashboard.

You can translate:

* Posts, Pages , Menus , Categories , Media details (alt text)

* No Monthly Cost

*  No External API

* No Coding Needed

This plugin uses Free Chrome’s **On-Device AI (Translator API)** — so translation happens inside the user’s browser. Data never leaves the device.



##  Why Use Easy WP Translator?

* **Free AI Translations** – Uses Chrome AI for free, no paid credits required.
* **Familiar WordPress UI** – Easy to use for beginners.
* **Works with Elementor & Gutenberg** – Fully compatible with famous page builders
* **Fast, Secure & Private** – No data is sent to servers.
* **No SaaS Lock-In** – Once installed, it’s fully yours.



##  How We Built It

We built this plugin using **Chrome’s built-in On-Device AI** (Translator API).
Everything happens *locally in the browser*:

*  No server involved
*  No API calls
*  No data sharing

### Simple Workflow

1. Open pages or posts
2. Click **Bulk Translate**
3. Choose languages
4. Your website becomes multilingual instantly
## Challenges We Faced

### 1. AI Could Not Understand Context

Chrome’s Translator API does not support adding **extra instructions or context**, so sometimes the translation was not correct for special words, industry terms, or brand tone.

### 2. HTML Formatting Got Mixed Up

While translating text with HTML tags, some tags got removed or changed by the AI.
We added extra logic to protect the important tags so the translated content keeps the right format and looks neat.

### 3. Language Settings Were Hard for New Users

Many users found it difficult to change or set language settings in Chrome.
Because we cannot directly link to Chrome settings pages, we had to guide users step-by-step and provide simple instructions inside the tool.

* Made website translation **easy for non-technical users**
* Fully **free and privacy-friendly** multilingual solution
* No dependency on external servers or paid APIs


##  What We Learned

* On-Device AI is **fast and secure** for translations
* Users love **simple UI with fewer steps**
* Most users skip documentation — so product must be self-explaining

This helped us build a smooth workflow that feels natural.
