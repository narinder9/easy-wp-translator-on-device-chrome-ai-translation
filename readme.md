# Inspiration 
Creating a multilingual website sounds exciting, but in real life, it’s often **confusing, costly, and time-consuming**. Many people use paid translation services or complicated plugins that need setup, subscriptions, and send website content to third-party servers.

When Chrome introduced **on-device AI**, we saw the perfect opportunity to fix all of this.
With translation running directly inside the browser, it’s now **super fast, fully private, and completely free**.


## Why Use Easy WP Translator?

* **Free AI Translations** – Uses Chrome AI for free; no paid credits needed
* **Familiar WordPress UI** – Easy to use for beginners
* **Works with Elementor & Gutenberg** – Fully compatible with popular page builders
* **Fast, Secure & Private** – No data is sent to external servers

### Testing Workflow

1. Open the **Pages** or **Posts** section in your WordPress dashboard.
2. Select the pages or posts you want to translate.
3. Click the **Bulk Translate** button.
4. Choose the target languages and click **Translate**.
5. If any Chrome AI configuration is missing, an error message will appear.
6. Click the **Error Details** button and **follow the steps shown in the Chrome popup** to enable translation settings.

   > (These errors depend on your Google Chrome configuration.)

7. **Download the required language pack** in your Chrome browser and **reload the page**.
8. Click the **Translate** button again.
9. That’s it! Your website content will now be translated instantly, making your site multilingual within seconds.
